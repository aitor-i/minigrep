I show less than I have to stay tasteful
Still catching hate cause they’re hateful
Too much food out the gate it’s a plateful
Now your girls full of tate and she’s grateful

I show less than I earn cause I’m humble
Your bitch in my ride coz you fumbled
Yes I hear couple pussydem grumble
But they don’t try n step I don’t stumble

I show less than I know I’ve stopped talking
Split the bullshit from truth I’ve been clocking
See me sit n don’t speak like im hawking
But there’s feet behind talk bitch i’m walking

I show less than I love but I miss her
Thinking back to the day that I kissed her
She left a sore on my heart there’s a blister
Fuck the next best thing that’s her sister
